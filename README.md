# ME2188 Step-Up Module

![Finished Module](finished_module.jpg)

This is a small step-up module based on the ![ME2188](/assets/pdf/me2188.pdf) chip, designed specifically for low-power 3.3V embedded systems. It allows you to boost the voltage from a single 1.5V battery to 3.3V, enabling you to power your projects efficiently.

## Features

- Compact size: 15.7mm x 15.7mm
- Designed for low-power 3.3V embedded systems
- All components on the front PCB layer
- External pins spaced 2.54mm for easy integration
- Input voltage: 1.5V (single battery)
