# ME2188 Step-Up Module

![Finished Module](placeholder_image_module.jpg)

This is a small step-up module based on the ME2188 chip, designed specifically for low-power 3.3V embedded systems. It allows you to boost the voltage from a single 1.5V battery to 3.3V, enabling you to power your projects efficiently.

## Features

- Compact size: 15.7mm x 15.7mm
- Designed for low-power 3.3V embedded systems
- All components on the front PCB layer
- External pins spaced 2.54mm for easy integration

## Specifications

- Input voltage: 1.5V (single battery)
- Output voltage: 3.3V
- Maximum current: [Maximum Current Value] (placeholder value)

## Usage

To use the ME2188 Step-Up module, follow these steps:

1. Connect the positive terminal of your 1.5V battery to the BATT+ terminal on the module.
2. Connect the negative terminal of your battery to the BATT- terminal on the module.
3. Connect your 3.3V load to the OUT+ and OUT- terminals.
4. Ensure that your load does not exceed the maximum current specified in the specifications.
5. Apply power to the module and verify the 3.3V output voltage.

Please refer to the datasheet and specifications provided by the manufacturer for more detailed information on the module's pinout, operating conditions, and other relevant details.
